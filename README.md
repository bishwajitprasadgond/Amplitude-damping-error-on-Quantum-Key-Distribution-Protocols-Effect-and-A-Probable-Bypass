# Amplitude damping error on Quantum Key Distribution Protocols: Effect and A Probable Bypass
### Abstract
Quantum Cryptography opened a new horizon in the field of cryptography. From theoretical perspective, protocols like BB84 and E91 looks too good until time of implementation comes. It is well known that real world quantum systems are not only very much fragile but also susceptible to error. So, implementing a quantum key distribution protocol comes with its own set of problems. In this paper, we implemented BB84 and E91 protocol and subjected it under only amplitude damping error model. This provided us to the insights how well they perform under amplitude damping error and how well the mathematical and theoretical explanation fits with our observed results. And lastly, we conclude about the protocols implementability under amplitude damping error and any possible modifications that will improve the protocol under the amplitude damping error.
